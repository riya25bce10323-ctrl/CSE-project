# Virtual Pet Simulation (Python)
## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple console-based Virtual Pet Simulator written in Python.
The player adopts a pet and interacts with it by feeding, bathing, sleeping, and playing.
Each action affects the pet’s stats—hunger, happiness, energy, cleanliness, and health. The pet’s mood also changes based on its condition. If any critical stat reaches zero, the pet dies and the game ends.

This project is perfect for beginners learning about:

# 🧪 Instructions for Testing

Run the game
You will be prompted to enter the pet’s name.

Observe initial status
The program displays all current stats.

Choose actions from the menu
Test different actions (feed, bath, sleep, play, bark, check status).

Verify stat changes

Feeding increases hunger but reduces cleanliness

Bathing increases cleanliness and happiness

Sleeping restores energy

Playing increases happiness but lowers energy and hunger

Test mood changes

Low hunger → "hungry"

Low energy → "sleepy"

Low health → "sick"

Low happiness → "sad"

Low cleanliness → "irritated"

Trigger a game over
Reduce any stat to 0 by repeated actions and confirm "Your pet is Dead" appears.
