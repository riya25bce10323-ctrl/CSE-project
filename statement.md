# 📄 Project Statement Document – Virtual Pet Simulation
## Problem Statement

Many beginner programmers want to learn how to apply fundamental programming concepts—such as functions, loops, data structures, and conditional logic—through simple and engaging projects. However, educational examples are often either too basic or lack interactive elements that keep learners engaged.

This project addresses this gap by providing a console-based virtual pet game where the user cares for a digital pet. The pet’s stats change dynamically based on the user’s actions, giving beginners a hands-on, fun way to understand how program state, game logic, and user input work together.

## Scope of the Project

The Virtual Pet Simulation project includes:

In Scope:

A text-based interface for interacting with a virtual pet

Basic actions such as feeding, bathing, sleeping, playing, and barking

Internal tracking of pet stats: hunger, energy, cleanliness, happiness, and health

Mood evaluation based on the pet’s current condition

Game-over logic when critical stats reach zero

A simple loop-based menu system

Out of Scope:

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Multi-pet management

Persistent data storage (saving/loading game progress)

Advanced AI decision-making

Multiplayer or network functionality

## Target Users

This project is designed for:

Beginner programmers learning Python basics

Students who want a simple project for assignments or practice

Teachers/instructors who need a clear, small-scale example of program logic

Anyone interested in creating simple simulation or game logic

## High-Level Features
✔ Pet Creation

Users can name their pet, which is initialized with default stats.

✔ Interactive Game Loop

A menu allows users to repeatedly choose actions to care for their pet.

✔ Dynamic Stat Management

Each action affects different stats (energy, hunger, happiness, cleanliness, health).

✔ Mood Evaluation

The pet's mood changes automatically depending on its current condition.

✔ Status Checking

Players can view updated stats at any time.

✔ Game-Over Condition

If any critical stat reaches zero, the pet “dies” and the game ends.
